<p>This is GitHub evidence of my progress regarding learning HTML.</p><br>
<p>It is currently October 20, 2023. Previously all my coding has been stored on <a href="https://ignisackerman.neocities.org/" alt="ignisackerman neocities">this website</a></p><br>
<p>My goal is to create a diary or journal type site where I can document my progress for learning HTML, CSS, and ideally Java and more in the future. I'd also like to complete the first freecodecamp certification by the end of October.</p>
